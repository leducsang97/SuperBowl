# SuperBowl
In this project, I'll be analyzing data on the Super Bowl. If you're unfamiliar with the National Football League, or NFL, it's an league consisting of 32 teams that play American football. The league is divided into two conferences of 16 teams each, the American Football Conference (AFC), and the National Football Conference (NFC). Each year, the top team from the NFC plays the top team from the AFC in the Super Bowl to determine the overall winner of the NFL.

We have a dataset called Super_Bowl.csv , which contains data on all of the Super Bowl games from 1967-2017.
